# Interactive Job Board Platform ‚Äì Project Nexus (ProDev FE)

## üìå Introduction

This project provides a hands-on opportunity to develop an **interactive job board platform** that aligns with real-world requirements. The platform allows users to explore, filter, and apply for job postings dynamically.

Through this case study, participants gain experience in:

* Building responsive, feature-rich applications with modern front-end technologies.
* Managing state effectively using the **Context API**.
* Ensuring accessibility and usability for diverse audiences.

2. **Advanced Filtering**

   * Filter job listings by **category, location, and experience level** (Entry, Mid, Senior).

3. **Responsive & Accessible Design**

   * Deliver an optimal browsing experience across devices.
   * Implement accessible forms and layouts (ARIA-compliant).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
